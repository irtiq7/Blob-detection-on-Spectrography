A code to detect key colours on a spectrography image of an audio file.

This code was made as a show to display the power of OpenCV as a tool to analyse signal.
In our case, a spectrometer of an audio file was used to detect a specific colour

After running the code, the red color would be segmented (masked!) and a green circle highlighting that region is shown
on the plot as shown below:

You are free to use the code as long as you <b>pinky promise</b> to share your knowledge with me!
